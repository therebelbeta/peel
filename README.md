![Peel](/peellogo-75.png?raw=true "Peel")

An API CMS. Think Wordpress but without the frontend. All content gets pushed to a RESTful JSON API. Built with NodeJS and AngularJS.

## Current status

**Version 0.0.0 (latest)**:

**Note:** **_peel_ is not yet ready for production**. It is still in scaffolding stages, and is more of a brain-child than anything right now.

_Peel_ is an API CMS framework (built on NodeJS) that will provide the following features:

- Creation of API endpoints directly within CMS
- Different User Roles to separate out API builders from content creators
- Stores and retrieves content via RESTful JSON API
- Content returned in Markdown for rich text experiences
- Analytics on content retrieval (eventually)

## Documentation

No documentation exists as of yet. I will probably be fleshing it out with Gitbook.
